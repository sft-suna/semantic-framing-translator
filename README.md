# Semantic Framing Translator (SFT)

**Translate the unspeakable** — An emotional and semantic framing translator powered by OpenAI’s GPT-OSS models.

## Overview
SFT analyzes user input (text, photos) and translates the underlying **emotional frames, tones, and philosophical nuances** into structured reflections.
It offers:
- **State Reflection**: Multidimensional snapshots of emotions
- **Resonance with Voices and Art**: Echoes through quotes, films, and music
- **Gentle Action Prompts**: Practical, nurturing suggestions
- **Photo Reflection**: Interpreting emotional layers in images

## Hackathon Updates
During the hackathon, we significantly updated SFT:
- Integrated **gpt-oss-120b** for advanced emotional translation
- Stabilized 3 interpretation modes (Poetic / Balanced / Practical)
- Enhanced Knowledge System for stronger language fidelity
- Structured outputs into consistent 7–9 section reflections
