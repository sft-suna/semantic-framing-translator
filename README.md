# Semantic Framing Translator (SFT)

**Translate the unspeakable** — An emotional and semantic framing translator powered by OpenAI’s GPT-OSS models.

## Overview
SFT analyzes user input (text, photos) and translates the underlying **emotional frames, tones, and philosophical nuances** into structured reflections.
It offers:
